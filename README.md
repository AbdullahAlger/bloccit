###Bloccit: 
##A Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails.

Made with my mentor Eliot Sykes at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

The project can be cloned by typing in the console 

`git clone https://github.com/AbdullahAlger/bloccit.git`

Once you have done that, remember to type `bundle install` to get all the required gems.

##What is this project of yours? 
It is a Reddit clone. users can login and create topics/posts/comments, delete owned topics/posts/comments, up vote topics/posts, and down vote topics/posts. It's pretty simple. There is also a tab that shows posts that are trending.
